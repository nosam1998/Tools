# Tools
Custom Tools that I wrote to make my life easier :)

This public repository doesn't even scratch the surface of Tools I've written for my personal and professional life. However, this is a good start. I'd have to obfucscate quite a bit, and some of the code is just downright nasty/embarassing haha.

This repository is years in the making. Thanks for checking it out!

**WARNING: Some of these tools are unfinished, and aren't actively maintained. I've recently pushed a few of the tools I wrote years ago, and these likely don't work. I did so for personal documentation reasons.**
