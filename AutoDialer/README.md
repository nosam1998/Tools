# AutoDialer

Currently, as a founder/business owner, I call a lot of people. This might be for customer discovery, product surveys, etc... It can be hard to keep track of all the businesses/people I've called.

Basically, this is a poor mans CRM. I didn't want to setup a full ERP/CRM for this, and I didn't want to use Excel either. Hence, why this exists :)
