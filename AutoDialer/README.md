# AutoDialer

Currently, as a founder/business owner, I call a lot of people. This might be for customer discovery, product surveys, etc... It can be hard to keep track of all the businesses/people I've called.

Basically, this is a poor mans CRM. I didn't want to setup a full ERP/CRM for this, and I didn't want to use Excel either. Hence, why this exists :)

## How to start

Prerequisites:
- Docker
- Your brain (this is very important!)

1. Clone the repo, copy the `example.env` file to `.env`, and fill out the values with your information.
2. Run `start.sh`
3. Go to [http://localhost:18080/](http://localhost:18080/) and viola!
