# I loan money on Solo

The information you get from Solo is meh. So I wanted to build a simple quick and dirty python script to scrape my email (you can run this script using a CRON job as well). This allows you to use any spreadsheet program to further analyze the data.

Fill out the .env file with your gmail username/email and password (app password).
